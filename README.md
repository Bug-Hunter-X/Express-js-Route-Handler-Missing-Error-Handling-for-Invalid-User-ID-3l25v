This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without any error checking. This can lead to unexpected crashes or exceptions if the ID is not a valid number. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring that the application gracefully handles invalid input and prevents unexpected behavior.
